## Purpose
This purpose of this project was to demonstrate mastery of topics learned in section 2 of the Break Into Tech Bootcamp.

## Requirements
Do each of the following at least once:

Group the data in a new way using a CASE statement.
Use a HAVING clause to determine something interesting about the data per category.
Use logical operators like AND or OR to filter the data in an interesting way.
Use an aggregate function like AVG, SUM, COUNT, MAX, and/or MIN to return summary statistics about the data.

1. Can you create a query that groups companies into three categories based on their revenue using a CASE statement, and then display the count of companies in each category?
2. Using a HAVING clause, find the industries where the average employee tenure is higher than 6 years, and display the industry names along with the average tenure.
3. Retrieve a list of companies that provide healthcare benefits AND have more than 20 paid time off days OR more than 10 maternity leave weeks. Display the company names and relevant details.
4. Calculate the total number of employees in the "Technology" industry and the "Healthcare" industry. Present the result in a single row with two columns - one for each industry.
5. Find the average revenue of companies in the "Retail" industry that have more than 5,000 employees AND provide healthcare benefits. Display the result along with the count of such companies.
