--This is the code I wrote as part of my final project for the SQL portoin of the "Break Into Tech" program. Below you will find the question asked and the code I wrote to provide the answer. 
[The tables used for this project can be found at](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/blob/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql).


The final project focused on creating queries across multiple tables with some question asking basic information and others requiring more involved queries to answer. --
